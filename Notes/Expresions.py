# VL 7th Expression Notes

# What is an algorithm
    # a set of instructions to complete a task
name = input("What is your name:\n")
print("Hello", name)

# 2 apples
apples =  12
friends = 5
print("Each friend gets", apples/friends, "apples!")
# List steps in an algorithm

# Average age of a group of 4 people
friend1 = 14
friend2 = 13
friend3 = 14
friend4 = 15
print("Average age of friends", (friend1+friend2+friend3+friend4)/4)
    # 1) Declare variables (get info thats needed)
    # 2) Preform any equations (do the equations) --> make the things different
    # 3) Display results (print the results)

# List ALL different Mathematical operators (symbol+tell what it does)
num1 = 12
num2 = 7

print("Addition(+): ", num1+num2)
print("Subtraction(-): ", num1-num2)
print("Multiplication(*): ", num1*num2)
print("division(/): ", num1/num2)
print("Exponents(**): ", num1**num2)
print("Integer Division(//): ", num1//num2)
print("Modulo(%): ", num1%num2)
# Integer dividing only gives a whole number 
# Floats are numbers with decimals
# Modulo is the left over amount of your division i.e your remainder

# List ALL of the different assignment operators (symbols+what it does)
