# VL 7th Expression Notes

# What is an algorithm
    # a set of instructions to complete a task
name = input("What is your name:\n")
print("Hello", name)

# 2 apples
apples =  12
friends = 5
print("Each friend gets", apples/friends, "apples!")
# List steps in an algorithm

# Average age of a group of 4 people
friend1 = 14
friend2 = 13
friend3 = 14
friend4 = 15
print("Average age of friends", (friend1+friend2+friend3+friend4)/4)
    # 1) Declare variables (get info thats needed)
    # 2) Preform any equations (do the equations) --> make the things different
    # 3) Display results (print the results)

# List ALL different Mathematical operators (symbol+tell what it does)
num1 = int(input("Tell me a number: \n"))
num2 = float(input("Tell me another number: \n"))
num1 +=num2
print("Addition(+): ", num1)
num1 -=num2
print("Subtraction(-): ", num1)
num1 *=num2
print("Multiplication(*): ", num1)
num1 /=num2
print("division(/): ", round(num1, 2)) # Round(number to round, number of decimal places we want)
num1 **=num2
print("Exponents(**): ", num1)
num1 //=num2
print("Integer Division(//): ", num1)
num1 %=num2
print("Modulo(%): ", num1)
# Integer dividing only gives a whole number 
# Floats are numbers with decimals
# Modulo is the left over amount of your division i.e your remainder

# List ALL of the different assignment operators (symbols+what it does)
    # assignment opperator = 
    # num1 +=num2
    # if you want a number inputed by the user, put input()

# Why are expressions so important in programming?
    # programming is math but it is math logic without the numbers. (Logic with no numbers)
